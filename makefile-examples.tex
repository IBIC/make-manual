\chapter{Makefile Examples}

\label{chap:examples}
This chapter includes examples of Makefiles included in the practical
data. We assume that you have unzipped the practical data into a
directory somewhere in your local environment. Once you have done
that, you should set an environment variable called
\texttt{MAKEPIPELINES} to refer to this directory. In the command below we assume you have placed it in your home directory:
\bashcmd{export MAKEPIPELINES=\textasciitilde{}/makepipelines}

The examples included below will reference this environment variable as necessary to find the correct files.
