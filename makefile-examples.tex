	\noindent This part includes examples of Makefiles included in the practical	data. We assume that you have unzipped the practical data into a directory somewhere in your local environment. Once you have done that, you should set an environment variable called \texttt{MAKEPIPELINES} to refer to this directory. In the command below we assume you have placed it in your home directory:
	\bashcmd{export MAKEPIPELINES=\textasciitilde{}/makepipelines}
	
	The examples included below will reference this environment variable as necessary to find the correct files.
